inecrypto
=========
The inecrypto library provides a small collection of useful cryptographic
functions.  The library is currently used by **Aion** low-code algorithm
development software and by the now defunct **SpeedSentry** site monitoring
system.  Both products are, or were, supported and sold by
`Inesonic, LLC <https://inesonic.com>`.

The inecrypto library uses code kindly taken from
https://github.com/kokke/tiny-AES-c.  The original source was released
under the unlicense (public domain) terms.
